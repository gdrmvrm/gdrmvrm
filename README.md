# Hi, I’m Gayathri 👋  
*(Phonetically: Gah-yuh-three)*

**Frontend Developer · London**

Former transportation engineer with 15 years of experience designing how people and goods move through cities across the UK, US, and the Middle East.

Today, I build the digital equivalent React applications that help users navigate complexity, whether that's agricultural supply chains, financial data, or anything that benefits from clear interfaces and systemic thinking.

### Why I switched to software

After delivering multi-million-pound infrastructure projects, I wanted to build things I could ship in weeks, not decades. Software gives me that, plus the satisfaction of solving real problems with code I can actually see working.

What carried over: 
- Translating between technical teams and stakeholders
- Tinking in systems
- A low tolerance for unnecessary complexity
