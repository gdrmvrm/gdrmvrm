# 👋 Hi, I'm Gayathri (Phonetically - Gaa-yuh-three)!

**Frontend Developer** based in London, previously a Transportation Engineer who spent 15 years planning how people and goods move through cities across the UK, US and Middle East.

Now I build the digital equivalent - **React applications that help users navigate complexity**, whether that's agricultural supply chains, financial data or anything that benefits from clear interfaces and systemic things.

### 💡Why I Made the Switch
After years of delivering multi-million-pound infrastructure projects, I realised I wanted to build things I could ship in weeks, not decades. Software gives me that plus the satisfaction of solving real problems with code I can actually see working.

What I brought with me: the ability to translate between technical teams and stakeholders, a habit of thinking in systems, and a low tolerance for unnecessary complexity.

### What I'm Building With
**Frontend** — React, TypeScript, Next.js, React Native, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
**Backend** — Node.js, Express, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
**Tools & Platforms** - Figma, Git/GitHub, AI assisted (Cursor, Claude, Github Co-pilot), Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Actions
**Testing & Practices** — Unit & Integration Tests, Cypress, TDD, accessibility-first, responsive design

### Currently
Looking for frontend roles at companies working on sustainability, fintech, or anything that actually matters. Particularly interested in teams that value clean code and clear communication over hustle culture.
